1-2-1 Guitar Lessons
======
Having played guitar for 14 years, it's fair to say I've had my fair share of guitar teachers! I have experience of teaching private guitar lessons weekly for clients.

All experience levels are welcome, with low prices and bundle deals available. I have played in rock, pop and jazz settings so I can teach the techniques required to any level for this. Most classes are 45 minutes long as we focus on a blended learning pattern where I will teach guitar technique alongside music theory so that the pupil can really understand what they're playing and how to develop their own, personal musicianship.
