Here you'll find essays and research I have undertaken to forward my knowledge during my undergraduate course. Topics include pyschoacoustics, computational creativity and ethnomusicology. As I move to third year I hope to research audio and sound design further, using my modules to do so.

This paper was written during my independent study module of 2nd year. It's far from perfect however I received a first for this work and put a lot of hours into research and learning

Music Therapy was my choice of essay writing for this module. I focus around the robust scientific methodology that should be applied to such work
